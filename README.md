# Distance-Estimator
It's a simple python program which uses cv2 to find out a face and estimate it's distance from the webcam. 
It uses harrascascade frontal face module to find the pattern of eyes and mouth to find the face
Later, the reference image captured is used to find the now length and width of the face captured.
Using that the actual face length is used and this value is later used to find the distance of the person from the webcam.
